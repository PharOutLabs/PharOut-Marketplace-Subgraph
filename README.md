# PharOut-Marketplace-Subgraph
Subgraph for the main-net marketplace contracts.

The PharOut MarketPlace uses the SubGraph for decentralized indexing of market orders across the several proxy contracts.

It was custom designed and written particularly for this marketplace, and may be expanded on in the future.

There are mainly 5-6 different MP contracts to consolidate, and unique rewards calculations done for the rewards contracts and all the users stats.
